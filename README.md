# ai_custom_chatbot

GenAI and Simple LLM Inference on CPU and finetuning of LLM Model to create a Custom Chatbot

## Features

- Loads a pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers.
- Runs inference on a CPU.
- Potentially includes functionality for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model (based on README description, not explicitly confirmed by code snippet).
- Uses the `transformers` library for model handling.
- Uses NumPy for numerical operations (likely for array handling within the model).
